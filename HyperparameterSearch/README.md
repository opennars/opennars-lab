# Hyperparameter search for openNARS

Disclaimer:
-----------
This repository has been migrated to https://github.com/opennars/opennars-applications under HyperparameterSearch. The code is now maintained there. Please check there for latest version.

What it Does:
-------------
Provides a hyperparameter tuning suite for the Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS) for applied use cases. Uses Hyperopt to sample a user defined search space and find the best performing parameters given a set of Narsese input files. 

How to Use:
-----------
Requires: Java, Python3, and Hyperopt for Python3

1. Place a NARS jar at the base of the repo. It can be built from the opennars git page:\
https://github.com/opennars/opennars

2. Recompile the java NARS wrapper with javac -cp opennars-3.0.4-SNAPSHOT.jar run_nars.java

3. If desired, edit the parameters, input files and run configurations in config.json.

4. If desired, a custom objective function can be added in objectives.py and pointed to by "optimization objective" in config.json.

4. Run with ./run_param_search.py or python3 run_param_search.py

Configuring Runs:
-----------------
Configurations are done through config.json
- NARS input files: A list of Narsese files to pass to NARS to reason about
- NARS parameters: System parameters for NARS. Must take format of either \["name", min-val, max-val\] or \["name", "True/False"\]. Refer to defaultConfig.xml for available NARS parameter fields.
- optimization objective: Benchmarking criteria for a NARS run. Must be the name of one of the functions in objectives.py. Default available functions include: "chain_length" (to minimize the length of the longest inference chain to reach a target statement), "num_cycles" (to minimize number of NARS cycles before deducing target statement), and "real_time" (to minimize the time NARS takes to conclude the target statement).
- failure penalty: The penalty value for runs where NARS fails to deduce all target statements.
- Hyperopt iterations: Number of Hyperopt iterations to run (number of parameter sets to test).
- NARS runs per iteration: Number of trials of NARS to run and average for a single iteration of Hyperopt.
- cpu threads: Number of cpu threads available for parallelizing runs of NARS.
- NARS timeout: Time in seconds before it is assumed NARS will not be able to deduce the target statements.
- require exact truth value: Whether a derived NARS statement can match a target even if the truth values are different. "True" to require exact match.
- batch timeout: Time in seconds before it is assumed one of the subprocesses hung and a batch needs to be run again.
- debug: Very verbose run of only a single iteration of hyperopt and a single run of NARS. "True" to turn on.

Implementation Details:
------------------
1. A set of parameters to benchmark is provided by the Hyperopt framework based on user provided ranges.
2. For each set of parameters, executes a user defined number of runs of NARS. Each instance of NARS runs as it's own subprocess and each starts from a random initial state. Randomly delay for up to 100 millisecond to ensure that the state of NARS varies when the narsese inputs are provided. 
3. NARS runs until all target statements of the Narsese file have been deduced by NARS or a specified timeout is reached.
4. Each run of NARS is benchmarked with an objective functions. The final loss for a set of parameters is taken to be the average performance across the runs of NARS.
5. Based on the results from this set of parameters, Hyperopt will propose another set of parameters. 
6. At the end, the set of parameters that led to the optimal result is kept and displayed.
